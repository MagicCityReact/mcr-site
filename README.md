Magic City React

About the site

We're all in Birmingham, AL, and we all love React. However, the city as a whole
hasn't picked up on it like we have. Our goal is to change that. Through this site
and local meetups, we hope to foster more local interest in React and React Native.
If we're lucky, we might even attract some talent to our city from around the country.

This site also serves as a learning experience. In our day jobs, we write business
applications. They're more pragmatic than public facing sites, so we don't always
get to use the flashy toys we'd like to use. So, this is our creative outlet.
