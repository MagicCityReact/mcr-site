# Developer Showcase

This section of the site will be available for group members as a playground.
Each module here will be available as a separate route in which each developer
will have their own sandbox to play with React as they see fit.

As the app progresses, we will have guidelines for including components and
submitting pull requests including registering routes with the router,
file structure, and code standards.
